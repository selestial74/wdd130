    <h1>Baguio City, Philippines</h1>

    <p>
        Baguio City is known as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines" because
        of its cool climate and refreshing mountain air. Located in the
        Cordillera region, it is one of the most popular tourist destinations
        in the country.

        Many Filipinos love Baguio City for its breathtaking landscapes,
        pine trees, and peaceful atmosphere. The city is also famous for
        strawberries, which are grown in nearby La Trinidad and sold fresh
